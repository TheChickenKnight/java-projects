Make a static class called Numbers that has the following methods:

 

Write a method called mean that returns the average of an array of numbers.  Accept the array as an argument.

 

Write a method called mode that returns the most frequently occurring element of an array of integers. Assume that the array has at least one element. Break ties by choosing the lower value. For example, if the array passed contains the values {27, 15, 15, 11, 27}, your method should return 15.

 

Write a method called stdev that returns the standard deviation of an array of integers. Standard deviation is computed by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between each element and the mean, divided by one less than the number of elements.  For example, if the array passed contains the values {1, -2, 4, -4, 9, -6, 16, -8, 25, -10} your method should be return approximately 11.237.

 

Write a method called median that accepts an array of integers as its argument and returns the median of the numbers in the array.  The median is the number that will appear in the middle if you arrange the elements in order.

 

Write a method called kthLargest that accepts an integer k and an array a as its parameters and returns the element such that k elements have greater or equal value.  If k = 0, return the largest element; if k = 1, return the second largest element, and so on.  For example, if the array passed contains the values {74, 85, 102, 99, 101, 56, 84} and the integer k passed is 2, your method should return 99 because there are two values at least as large as 99.

 

note: You can not use Arrays.sort() for this program.  You can acquire your own sort, but I want you to have to place it into your program.

Also, I want Javadocs.  You just need to comment it. Remember /**
*/

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }

}
